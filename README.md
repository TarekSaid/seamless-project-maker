# Seamless Project Maker
Seamless Project Maker (S.P.M) aims to be a simple, lightweight and fast UML CASE tool to design projects.

It's inspired by both Umlet's simplicity and Enterprise Architect's powerful features:

* Cross-platform;
* Simple interface:
  * drag components from the component palette to the canvas;
  * auto-layout option (draw and forget);
  * programmable diagrams: use plain text and auto-complete to quickly import link components and create UML diagrams.
* Manage the project's lifecycle:
  * Create, import and share entire projects;
  * Components are *linked* to diagrams, so that changes to a component reflects on every diagram it is used;
  * Export files to eps, pdf, jpg, png, from a single diagram to the entire project;
* It supports version control systems (such as SVN and GIT) to share projects:
  * Faster and easier than using a DBMS repository, safer than a shared network directory;
  * No need to lock diagrams or projects before working on them;
  * Use built-in or external commands to import, update or commit changes to a project;
